# WMW-v1.5

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A frontend weather app written in React + TypeScript + Tailwind! What's different in this version versus the one I did before? We refactored the entire app to be in TypeScript with Tailwind as the CSS framework!

## Usage

This work in progress can be found deployed [here](https://wmw-v1.netlify.app/).

## Improvements

The following have been considered in an improved working version:

- a server to hide the API key
- include a search dropdown button
- integrate Leaflet to include a map with radar
- improved UI with info cards
- include forecast of 5-day weather
